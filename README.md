Hello there, I'm Lakshmi 🥰 I'm an undergrad senior majoring in Computer and Communication Engineering.
I'm a passionate software engineer, a self-taught UX designer and a frontend developer.
I draw my passion from dreaming up ideas and making them come true using designs and codes, with a touch of aesthetics to the interfaces ✨

☝🏻🤓 I'm a sucker for open-source platforms. I've learnt more from the open-source platforms and communities than anywhere else. I'm currently learning DevOps and Flutter. And React.

💼 Any freelace work for UX design? do reach me through email :)

If you like what I do, please consider buying me coffee ☕️🐣
